# Database Backups

This directory contains database backup files created by the management script.

Backup files are named with timestamp: `backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql`

## Usage

Create backup:
```bash
./database/manage-db.sh backup
```

Restore from backup:
```bash
./database/manage-db.sh restore ./database/backups/backup_20231201_120000.sql
```

## Important Notes

- Backups are created in SQL format compatible with PostgreSQL
- Keep regular backups before major changes
- Backup files can be version controlled if needed (but watch file sizes)
- Consider automated backup scheduling for production
